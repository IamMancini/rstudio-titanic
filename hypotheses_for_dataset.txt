1. Hypothesis (Women+Children surviving rate compared to men): 

Women and children were more likely to survive the sinking of the Titanic than men. This hypothesis is based on the belief that women and children were given priority when it came to boarding lifeboats.

---------------------------------------

2. Hypothesis (Higher classes were more likely to survice): 

Passengers in higher classes (e.g., first class) were more likely to survive than those in lower classes (e.g., third class). This hypothesis is based on the belief that passengers in higher classes had more access to lifeboats and better accommodations.

---------------------------------------

3. Hypothesis (Passangers alone higher likely to survive than group): 

Passengers traveling alone were more likely to survive than those traveling with family members. This hypothesis is based on the belief that individuals traveling alone were more mobile and able to reach the lifeboats more quickly.

---------------------------------------

4. Hypothesis (The more they paid the higher the survival rate): 

Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive than those who paid lower fares. This hypothesis is based on the belief that passengers who paid higher fares had better accommodations and may have had more access to lifeboats.

---------------------------------------

5. Hypothesis (Different harbor ports created a different survival rate): 

Passengers who embarked from certain ports were more likely to survive than others. This hypothesis is based on the belief that passengers who embarked from ports closer to the sinking of the Titanic may have had less time to react and reach the lifeboats.
